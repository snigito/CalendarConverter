# Calendar Converter project 

After I finished registering for classes I wanted to put all of them into a schecdule on outlook calendar for the year. Unfortunatly there was no good way to export the class list to outlook.
I was able to get it in the form of a .xml file but outlook will only accept a .ics file (Internet Calendaring and Scheduling) standard for many email and calendar programs. This program converts the class list from .xml to .ics so I could see my classes on my schedule and make planning easier.
